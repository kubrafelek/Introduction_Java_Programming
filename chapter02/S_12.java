/*Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula: length = v2 / 2a.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.*/
