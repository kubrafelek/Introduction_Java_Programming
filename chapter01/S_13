/*(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
            ax + by = e
            cx + dy = f
         
         x = ed - bf / ad - bc
         y = af - ec / ad - bc
Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
          3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
          2.1x + .55y = 5.9
